        The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or with a text-based console application by entering text input through the computer keyboard, and by reading text output from the computer terminal.
        A console traditionally refers to a computer terminal where a user may input commands and view output such as the results of inputted commands or status messages from the computer. The console is often connected to a remote computer or computer system that is controlled from the console.
